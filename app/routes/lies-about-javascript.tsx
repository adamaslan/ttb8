          Sometimes it's important to take a break from JavaScript and just find out weird things about the internet. Sooo...lettuce dive in a bit. So sure, JavaScript is cool but what does it do? Well, that's a challenging thing to say with the rise of NodeJS and the developments of HTML5. </p>
        <br /> <p className="text-left text-xl font-extrabold tracking-tight sm:text-2xl lg:text-4xl">For example, many will say you need JS for validating input values of a form before the data is sent to a web server, but HTML5 is also doing great work with form validation. So it would be a big rotten lie to say JS is the only way to do form validation on the world wide web and people are really leaning into shipping less JS these days so maybe it's time to dive even deeper into html form validation.
